A game played between an unknown grandmaster and myself.

<br>

1 **e4 c5**<br>
2 **Nf3 d6**<br>
3 **d4 cxd4**<br>
4 **Nxd4 Nf6**<br>
5 **Nc3 g6**<br>
6 **Be3 Bg7**<br>
7 **f3 0-0**<br>
8 **Qd2 Nc6**<br>
9 **0-0-0 d5**<br>

Once again, I find myself in a Sicilian Dragon against a much higher rated player. This time it's the modern line with White castling queenside instead of deploying the light-squared bishop to c4. If Black plays the same move (Bd7) that he normally would against Bc4, then White gets a sizeable advantage with g4.
